### Case study

* 接口设计
    * polygon.py/mypolygon.py
* word play
    * wordplay.py
* dictionaries
    * dictory.py
        * 字典作为计数器集合
        * 循环和字典
        * 逆向查找
        * 字典和列表
        * 备忘录
* data structure selection
    * my_analyze_book.py
* 类和对象
    * point_rectangle.py
        * Write a function called distance_between_points that takes two Points as ar- guments and returns the distance between them.
        * Write a function named move_rectangle that takes a Rectangle and two numbers named dx and dy. It should change the location of the rectangle by adding dx to the x coordinate of corner and adding dy to the y coordinate of corner.
        * Write a version of move_rectangle that creates and returns a new Rectangle instead of modifying the old one.
* 类和方法
    * point.py
        * Write an init method for the Point class that takes x and y as optional parameters and assigns them to the corresponding attributes.
        * Write a str method for the Point class. Create a Point object and print it.
        * Write an add method for the Point class.
        * Write an add method for Points that works with either a Point object or a tuple:
            * If the second operand is a Point, the method should return a new Point whose x coordinate is the sum of the x coordinates of the operands, and likewise for the y coordinates.
            * If the second operand is a tuple, the method should add the first element of the tuple to the x coordinate and the second element to the y coordinate, and return a new Point with the result.
* 继承
    * card.py
